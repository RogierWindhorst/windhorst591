[Zoom passwd: 1234 in case Zoom asks for one. You must login via: asu.zoom.us
and my.asu.edu to enter any ASU Zoom room, or the Google drive with
presentations. If you get stuck in the Zoom waiting room, you need to go to the
Zoom app and sign into Zoom with your ASU email address. Then, sign back into
Zoom]. We are aware of a few on-line students that can only attend class by
Zoom, which is allowed. If you are an in-person student, you are expected to
attend in GWC-505. Prof. Windhorst will need to Zoom into class and his office
hours for the first couple of weeks due to medical reasons, as he will be
recovering from surgeries. Tim Carleton has kindly agreed to setup the Zoom in
GWC-505 before each Mo noon class-time.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
<b> Course Objectives and Topic for this Semester: </b><br>

</p><p>

The aim of this course is to introduce the students to a series of short
seminal papers on more recently published work in the general area of this
semester's broad topic: Astrophysics and Cosmology with the Webb and Hubble
Space Telescope, and with other Facilities. The emphasis is on the development
of scientific method and theory, and on the latest scientific discoveries,
rather than just on new measurements or incremental improvement in one
particular technique.<br>

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
<b> Course Requirements: </b><br>

</p><p> During this semester's Journal Club, each enrolled student will give a
20-25 min oral presentation on their selected paper in class. Given the large
number of AST 494/591 students signed up this semester, we will hold of two
~20-25 minute presentations per week, each followed by 5-10 min discussion. We
will therefore strictly start on time and adhere to two 30 min slots for each
class period --- just like the strict time schedule used during our AAS
conferences! Students who have not been able to sign up for a paper
presentation slot (because there may be more students than available speaker
slots this semester) may suffice with leading the discussion of other
presenter's papers during the semester, for which they may also receive credit.
Paper presentations by volunteer senior graduate students, postdocs, and
others not enrolled in this class, will be allowed only if speaker slots become
available. 

</p><p>

The presentation of your paper should consist of a general introduction
covering the scope of the paper and where it fits within the larger field of
research of which the paper is part, followed by a more detailed summary of the
paper and a discussion of its impact. This includes a summary of the
assumptions made in the paper, the new observational data obtained or
theoretical methods used, the reduction and analysis procedures applied to the
data, the reliability and completeness of these procedures, and the reliability
and relevance of the new scientific results presented in the paper. Each
presentation is followed by a 5-10 min time slot for questions &amp; answers, and
subsequent discussion, in which especially the students who take this class for
a grade will engage. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
<b> Class Grading: </b><br>

</p><p> Your grade will be based on your active participation in this class, on the
quality of your presentation, the importance of your presented paper for the
field, and how well you answer all questions on you representation from other
class students who will act as your peers. Typically, students will receive an
A (or A+) in this class for a job (very) well done -- we do not intend to give
out B-D grades (unless you throw in the towel), but students who could not sign
up for a presentation, or are auditing the class, may opt for a Pass/Fail grade
instead. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
<b>Journal Club Presentations and Schedule:</b><br>

</p><p>

Dates for the presentations(s) by each student will be assigned within the
first week of the first class --- on a first come, first serve basis. The
choice of paper to discuss will be up to the student, but certain restrictions
and requirements will apply (<font color="#ff0000">see also <i>Tips.</i>,
below</font>). We will be happy to discuss your choice of a particular paper,
and offer suggestions when you are in doubt as to what is best.

</p><p>

The majority of the work for this class will revolve around computer-based
presentations (i.e., PDF, PPT, or HTML format). A laptop computer running
Redhat&nbsp;9, or CentOS Linux, or MAC O/S (with a Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
browser, Acrobat PDF Reader, and OpenOffice for PPT files) will be available
in the classroom to give the presentation, but students are encouraged to bring
and use their own Windows, Linux or Macintosh laptop should they have one. If
you use your own laptop, remember to bring the proper HDMI cable adapter 
("dongle"), as the assortment in GWC-505 is limited. 

</p><p>

<font color="#ff0000">At least ONE WEEK BEFORE</font> their scheduled
presentation, each student should provide Tim Carleton and Rogier Windhorst
with the reference to a paper of their choice. We will place a link on this
class web-page to an electronic version of this paper (URL or PDF file), so
that all other students can download and read it, and formulate questions 
well before the class starts, and so more effectively participate in the 
discussion of that paper during class. From experience, students will learn a
lot less if they don't read the paper before it is being discussed. 

</p><p>

If you prepare a presentation and do <font color="#ff0000"> not</font> plan to
use your own laptop, post your PDF (preferred format) or PPT presentation <font color="#ff0000">no later</font> than the afternoon preceding class to Tim by
e-mail attachment or via an URL, so that we can check that it displays properly
(Windows' proprietary fonts, e.g., math symbols, often don't!). Tim will place
all presentations and papers (PDF, PPT, or URL format) on the URL repository
below, so they can be accessed by all class students. Details are available
via links in the <a href="http://windhorst591.asu.edu/#01"> Table below </a> that contains this semester's
TENTATIVE Journal Club schedule (this Schedule is subject to change throughout
the semester!).

</p><p>

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
<b>Tips for finding a suitable paper:</b><br>

</p><p>

Papers that had/have a large impact will be cited by many other authors. <font color="#ff0000">Papers with few or no citations, or mostly self-citations by
the authors, are <i>not suitable</i> for discussion</font>. Papers are required
to: (1) <font color="#ff0000">have been peer reviewed, and preferably be already
published a peer reviewed journal</font> and (2) <font color="#ff0000">have at
least 3 citations</font> by researchers other than the authors of that paper.
In general, discussion of a paper that recently appeared on 'astro-ph' is
discouraged, unless the "Comments" give a <i>specific</i> volume/issue of the
peer-reviewed journal, where such paper is scheduled to appear and/or the
citation requirement is satisfied. (This semester we will be a bit more lenient
on these rules, given the very recent nature of the new JWST etc data that is
coming in). 

</p><p>

For a 20-25 min presentation, a single 4 or 5-page ApJ Letters may be suitable,
or a longer journal paper. Typically, papers should be the equivalent of
8–10 pages in a main journal (multi-page tables or atlases of figures,
and the list of references don't count).<br>

</p><p>

Although not a complete depository of all scientific literature in astronomy
and astrophysics, astronomy has nonetheless a very large, full-text digital
library: the <b>NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS): </b>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html"><b>
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html</b></a> .
The best and most complete astronomical preprint server is on:

Evaluation Form,</a> and return it to Tim at the end of that class period. (An
electronic way of logging these comments may instead be used, i.e. via a Google
docs, TBD). Like the real refereeing process in publishing scientific papers,
you may remain anonymous in your comments. But please be polite in your
comments, because you, too, will one day will be judged by your peers!
